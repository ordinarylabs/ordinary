# ordinary.

it's ugly. will get better. if you try to read it you'll probably cry and lose hope for humanity but i won't stop you.

stuff is going to get updated rapidly because of how embarrassed i am by what's in here.

if you need to renew hope in the concept just look at system/core/src/ops, and know that's basically all we need to get wrapped on to start building plugins/extensions.

extensions will be how we "proxy the world" while we shift the full functionality into being supported by the built-in storage engine.

this will work... eventually.
